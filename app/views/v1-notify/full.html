      <p>Dear Sarah Smith,</p>

      <p>Thank you for starting your Personal Independence Payment (PIP) claim.</p>

      <p>We need to find out more information about your daily living and mobility needs to help us make our decision.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do</h2>

      <p>1. Fill in the How your disability affects you form: <a href="#">[link]</a></p>

      <p>Please open and save your form onto a computer, tablet or phone straightaway as this link will only work for seven days. </p>

      <p>If the link has expired or you lose the documents, please call 0800 121 4433 or Textphone: 0800 121 4493 if you have speech or hearing difficulties and ask us to resend them to you.</p>

      <p>You can fill in the form on a computer, tablet or phone. You do not need to print it out. It works best on a computer or tablet. More information about completing the form can be found in: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the How your disability affects you booklet <a href="#">[link]</a></li>
        <li>PIP Additional Information <a href="#">[link]</a></li>
        <li>a Flyer that explains the types of supporting evidence you should send <a href="#">[link]</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>2. Gather any supporting evidence that shows how your condition or disability affects you.</p>

      <p>3.  Upload your completed form and any supporting evidence to <a href="#">[URL]</a> by [93 days from todayâ€™s date] or sooner if you can. </p>

      <p>If you do not send the form back by this date we may end your PIP claim. If you currently get Disability Living Allowance this will stop.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get help</h2>

      <p>You can ask a friend, relative, carer, representative, or local support organisation to help you complete the form either over the phone or in person if they live with you or visit you for a medical reason or to provide care.</p>

      <p>Get help with filling in the form and providing supporting evidence: <a href="#">[link to info booklet]</a></p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Evidence to support your claim</h2>

      <p>Get help with the types of supporting evidence you should send: <a href="#">[link to flyer and further info attachment]</a></p>

      <p>Watch a DWP video about providing evidence to support your claim:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCMRGukO1TM&list=PLeysxjNpEPy8Y73-Ywm7OeAGjFc1Xc-It&index=3">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCMRGukO1TM&list=PLeysxjNpEPy8Y73-Ywm7OeAGjFc1Xc-It&index=3</a></p>

      <p>Do not delay sending your form back if you are waiting for more supporting evidence.</p>

      <p>Only send us supporting evidence you have already.</p> 

      <p>Do not contact your GP or health professional to ask for new or additional information as they may charge you for this.</p>

      <p>Do not leave the house to collect supporting evidence or contact your doctor or hospital during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

      <p>We may call you to check you have received this email and if you need any support. When you have returned your form, you will get an email or text message to confirm that we have received your form. </p>

      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

      <p>Office Manager</p>
